# App-3-WhereToGo-
This is an Android mobile phone application developed with AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3, PHP and Sql(with a remote database) in Ionic 2 Framework. 
The code is in spanish and the final result is in spanish too. The name of the app is "WhereToGo?"

The app is a center where people can know which events are in Canary Islands, because in Canary Islands there are so low information 
and visibility of the events or parties that are there. So, the purpose of this app is let the user know about them and meet people for go
together. Is like Where2B that exists in Poland but in Canary Islands.

In the main page there is a menu with a slideview with text that contains information about the app and a three tabs where the users
can choose register, log in or forget password. Once you are registered it will send you a welcome email with your password and your
user. 

Once you log in, an agenda will appears with the events that you said you will go (obviously if you are new it will appears that you 
don't have any events). 

Also you have a top menu with three icons that have different functions:
- "+" button: will show you all the next events. Once you select one it will appears a page with the photo of the event and more 
information about it. Also, you can see which people is going to the event too and see their profiles pushing on them
(and if you think that his profile is annoying you can report it with a button to our support system). 
- "face" button: there you can modify your profile, add things that you like, modify your username..etc.
- "turn off" button: it works for log out from the application.

The final result is in " final apk" folder.

* This application is in an Alpha phase, so there are many bugs in it and many things will be added in a future (english version,
chat between users, gps..etc.).
